## JSX Transformation in React

The `App.js` in the `src` folder contains a function that returns something, and this function is then rendered in the `index.js` file. 

So how does `<App/>` work in the `index.js` as an element since `App` is a function? This is made possible by the Babel bundler behind the scenes in React, and it's known as JSX.

Although `App` is a function, we can execute it like `App()` instead of `<App/>` inside the `index.js`, but we typically do not do so as it's not the convention followed by React.

At the end of the day, the code inside the `App.js` file:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```
is converted by Babel or some other bundler into something like this:

```javascript
function App() {
  return React.createElement(
    'div',
    { className: 'App' },
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!')
  );
}
```
This transformation allows us to write JSX for defining UI components in a more intuitive and readable way, while still being able to leverage the power of JavaScript functions and libraries like React.
